# Sorting Visualizer <br/>
Visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library. A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a list in a certain order. While there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms predominate. <br/>
First install the SDL library then run this code. <br/>
The sorting algorithms covered here are Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.\n
